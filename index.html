          Knicks’ Evan Fournier breaks 3-point record in win over Hornets: ‘I can’t stop until I’m the best’
        </h1>

        <img src=https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/03/24010525/AP22083058812861-scaled-e1648098422475-1024x683.jpg alt="theathletic.com width="208" height="284
">

        <p>
          The rules were simple: Pick seven spots lining the 3-point arc. A shooter fires from each spot, over and over again, until he misses two straight. Once he clanks a couple in a row, he moves on to the next spot. Once he’s done with all seven, add up all his makes. That’s his final score.
        </p>

        <p>
          But back when he was with the Magic, Evan Fournier wouldn’t play the game — at least, not against Orlando sizzler Terrence Ross.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ross had the gym record; something around 225, former Magic assistant coach Steve Hetzel recalled. The champ wanted to go against the team’s best, so he challenged Fournier, one of the Magic’s top 3-point slayers. Yet, Fournier refused.
        </p>

        <p>
          The player who is now the Knicks’ starting shooting guard remembered obsessing over similar one-on-one shootouts in the past, so much so that he developed tendinitis in his elbow just because he wouldn’t drop it. He shot for so long, too long, that he hurt himself. The fixation on winning overpowered the pain.
        </p>

        <p>
          “If I do this drill,” Hetzel remembers Fournier telling him, “I won’t stop until I beat him. … I can’t stop until I’m the best.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The showdown never happened.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          “It’s not that he was backing down from the challenge,” said Hetzel, now an assistant with the Trail Blazers. “It was that he had a greater purpose of, I’m not gonna get tendinitis in my elbow because I know I won’t stop until I beat him.”
        </p>
          
          <a href="https://youtu.be/ZCHRulUcJI4">Maybe it’s finally time Fournier calls up his former teammate for a match.</a>
